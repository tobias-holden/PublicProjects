abstract: A major barrier to malaria elimination is the abundance of chronic infections with asexual parasite densities low enough to avoid symptoms –and thus treatment –but gametocyte densities high enough to perpetuate transmission. Screening, testing, and treatment (STT) interventions detect and treat asymptomatic gametocyte carriers, interrupting transmission. STT has been evaluated through clinical trials, and mathematical models have been used to extrapolate the impact of STT to new contexts. We leveraged detailed parasite, gametocyte, and infectivity data froman STT trial  in  Burkina  Faso  (INDIE  trial),  to  recalibrate  the  within-host  component  of  the  established malaria transmission model, EMOD. Our recalibration yielded new, internally consistent  within-host parameters suitable for modeling expansion of STT. Compared to previous EMOD versions, our model showed increased infectivity of chronic infections. Additionally, we generated a spatial model of malaria transmission in a highly seasonal and endemic West African setting, providing a platform to explore other interventions.
